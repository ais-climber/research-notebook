	abstract = {We present a bimodal logic suitable for formalizing reasoning about points and sets, and also states of the world and views about them. The most natural interpretation of the logic is in subset spaces, and we obtain complete axiomatizations for the sentences which hold in these interpretations. In addition, we axiomatize the validities of the smaller class of topological spaces in a system we call topologic. We also prove decidability for these two systems. Our results on topologic relate early work of McKinsey on topological interpretations of S4 with recent work of Georgatos on topologic. Some of the results of this paper were presented (Moss and Parikh, 1992) at the 1992 conference on Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Knowledge.},

	abstract = {In joint work with Peter O'Hearn and others, based on early ideas of Burstall, we have developed an extension of Hoare logic that permits reasoning about low-level imperativeprograms that use shared mutable data structure.The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a "separating conjunction" that asserts that its sub-formulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related "separating implication". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing.In this paper, we will survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures. We will also discuss promising future directions.},

@incollection{Pratt:1982aa,
	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses that dynamic logic is a system for reasoning about action. It also focuses on a class of algebras defined by a system of equations, example, groups, rings, Boolean algebras, modal algebras, called a ``variety.'' Varieties are closed under homomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products. This is because these operations preserve equational identities. A stereotypical approach to logic begins with propositional calculus and then generalizes to first-order logic. By way of showing where dynamic logic might fit into a development of logical concepts, a more leisurely progression is described. The mathematics of propositional calculus is that of Boolean algebras, of first-order logic polyadic algebras, or cylindric algebras if equality is included. A Boolean algebra is a complemented distributive lattice. Quantifiers themselves may be considered the possible modalities for dynamic logic in thinking of its modalities as actions.},

@article{Baltag:2006aa,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a dynamic logic formalism for reasoning about information flow in composite quantum systems. This builds on our previous work on a complete quantum dynamic logic for single systems. Here we extend that work to a sound (but not necessarily complete) logic for composite systems, which brings together ideas from the quantum logic tradition with concepts from (dynamic) modal logic and from quantum computation. This Logic of Quantum Programs (LQP) is capable of expressing important features of quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of multi-partite states, as well as giving logical characterisations to various forms of entanglement (for example, the Bell states, the GHZ states etc.). We present a finitary syntax, a relational semantics and a sound proof system for this logic. As applications, we use our system to give formal correctness proofs for the Teleportation protocol and for a standard Quantum Secret Sharing protocol; a whole range of other quantum circuits and programs, including other well-known protocols (for example, superdense coding, entanglement swapping, logic-gate teleportation etc.), can be similarly verified using our logic. },
